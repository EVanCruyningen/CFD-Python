# CFD-Python

This project is to follow the [12 Steps for CFD in Python by Professor Barba.](url) As of 4/9 I am currently on step 6, working on streamlined flow over an airfoil. The first four steps are pre written, but steps 5 and 6, and presumably the remaining number, are written by me with general instructions given. My long term plans are to create a similar 12 steps in C++ to enhance my knowledge of C++ and to create a functional application. Eventually, I would like to make this an interactive website where the user can draw a shape and examine the airflow over that shape.
